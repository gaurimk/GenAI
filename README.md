# GenAI
This project demonstrates the implementation of Generative AI (GenAI) concepts using Large Language Models (LLMs) and Embedding Models. It focuses on building foundational GenAI components such as text generation, embeddings, and retrieval-ready pipelines using modern AI frameworks.

The project is designed for learning, experimentation, and extension into RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) systems.
